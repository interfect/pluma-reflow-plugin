===================
Reflow Pluma plugin
===================

This plugin allows to automatically format paragraphs to 80 characters.
This is similar to emacs <alt>-q command that I love so much.


Install
-------

Copy the files reflow.pluma-plugin and reflow.py into your pluma plugin
directory (for example, /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pluma/plugins), then restart
pluma.


Usage
-----

After installation a new command 'Reflow' is available in the edit menu.  You
can also directly use <alt>-q.  Use this command anywhere in the document to
automatically format the current paragraph.
